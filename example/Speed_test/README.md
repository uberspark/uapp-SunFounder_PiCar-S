## Usage
- Copy the script in the /example folder
- Execute the python script by using
- ```
- python3 Speed_regulator.py
- ```
- Running the code will generate two text file where distant0.txt collect the distance reading and speed0.txt which collects the speed.
- Once the content of these two text file are done, open distant.m in Matlab and run it. Make sure those text files are in the same folder as the matlab code. 
- The graph should be shown then saved after closing.
- I comment out the condition where I ignore large distance over 100cm.
